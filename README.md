# Interactive Arud Explorer

The Interactive Arud Explorer is a React-based web application designed to visualize and educate users about Arabic poetry meters (Arud), following the classical system established by Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi. This application allows for an in-depth exploration of all five traditional prosodic circles and their associated 16 classical meters through an engaging, interactive "roulette" style visualization.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Meter Visualization**: Experience the structure of Arabic poetry meters through a dynamic, circular "roulette" animation that illustrates how meters are formed from fundamental syllabic units.
*   **Comprehensive Prosodic System**: Explore all five traditional circles of Arabic prosody, each containing unique meters and patterns.
*   **Educational Content**: Gain insights into each meter with detailed descriptions, historical context, and classical examples.
*   **RTL Support**: A fully responsive design with complete right-to-left (RTL) text directionality, catering to Arabic language users.
*   **Themed Experience**: Each prosodic circle is presented with its own distinct visual theme, enhancing the learning experience.

## Technical Stack
